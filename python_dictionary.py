# Creating a dictionary 

# Accessing keys

# Accessing values

# Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:

```
for x in thisdict:
  print(x)
```

# Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:

```
for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])
```

# You can also use the values() function to return values of a dictionary:

  print(x)
```
